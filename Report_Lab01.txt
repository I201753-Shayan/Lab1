Results: 
Accuracy of KFolds (manual) : 0.87
Accuracy of KFolds (SKlearn): 0.89

Conclusion:
By lienent comparison, we can conclude that both of the experiments have the same accuracies, but in a strict view, we would
conclude that SK-learn is better by almost 0.03. Several reasons such as data distribution, etc can make a difference.
